Data, code, and files for my Fall 2010 semester first-year rotation in the Taylor lab. The aim of this project is to model inbreeding and selection in a metapopulation, and the work of the project is all code and thought-based. The modeling framework I am extending is quantiNEMO.

Roughly, the major organization of this project is as such:
    /               This (toplevel) folder
    /README.txt     This file
    /src/           The (modified) quantiNEMO source code
    /doc/           Documentation for quantiNEMO and other things
    /results/       The results and output from runs
